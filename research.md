In the age of big data, individuals rely on more data sources than ever before to assess the safety of a neighborhood, including crime maps, social media, and Google Maps. This has implications for how people choose to live, work, and shop, and can also contribute to the segregation of communities. This study uses a survey experiment and semi-structured interviews to investigate how individuals navigate and interpret this wealth of information, and how it shapes their perceptions of neighborhood safety. The findings will provide insights into how people trust and interpret new data sources, which has broader implications for decision-making in various markets.

Owning a home is often seen as a key part of the American Dream, but rising housing costs have made it harder for average people to afford homes, with more affluent individuals and corporations viewing houses as financial investments. This study explores the moral beliefs of Americans regarding who should have the opportunity to buy a house in the United States. Using a survey experiment on a sample of 1,983 Americans, the research reveals a surprising departure from a purely market-driven perspective, as Americans, irrespective of political affiliations, express a preference for selling houses to fellow citizens planning to use them as primary residences rather than to the highest bidder. The findings highlight concerns about fairness and the deservingness of homebuyers, shedding light on a significant aspect of market dynamics that has been overlooked by sociologists and emphasizing a misalignment between moral values and the current state of the housing market.
