							<h3>A Little Bit About Me <!-- <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe... bit</small> --></h3>

                            <h4>General Info</h4>
                            <p>
							I recently graduated from Georgia Tech, where I studied computer science. I am currently employed at Google as a software engineer.
							</p>

							<p>
							As far as programming languages go, I'm most familiar with Java, Python, C, C#, and JavaScript. I also have experience using CSS, HTML, AngularJS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. In my spare time I have worked on a few video games in Unity, created a couple of websites, and written various Python scripts to automate tasks for me.

                            <h4>Internships</h4>

                            <i>Amazon</i>
                            <p>
                            Summer of 2019, I worked at Amazon as a software development engineer intern. I worked on a prototype of a new authentication method for the Amazon mobile apps. The authentication features I worked on are expected to greatly reduce the account takeover rate for Amazon customers.
                            </p>


                            <i>First Data</i>
							<p>
                            Summer of 2018, I worked at First Data as a software development intern. I created an application monitoring UI, giving developers quick access to important information regarding the status of applications. The monitoring application gets a list of apps from a (Netflix) Eureka service registry and pulls information from the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints of each registered application. The application stores metrics values in a SQL database; these values are used to generate charts displaying a historical overview of the metrics.
                            </p>


                            <i>Central Technology Services</i>
                            <p>
							Summer of 2017, I worked at Central Technology Services (under Central Bancompany) as a software development intern. I developed bug fixes for their website and created a web application backed by a SQL database to store and manage properties that are used by the bank's mobile apps. Developers can manage the properties through the web application, and the mobile app makes an API request to get the correct properties from the database for that version of the app. I also updated their Android app to use Google Maps API v2, and refactored the app to reduce duplicate code and use Android’s “Product Flavors” instead of separate projects for different app versions.
							</p>

                            <h4>Additional Experience</h4>

                            <i>Teaching Assistant</i>
                            <p>
                            Spring 2018, I was a teaching assistant for CS 2050 (Discrete Math). Since Fall 2018, I have been a teaching assistant for CS 3510 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms). As a TA I lead recitation sections with my Co-TAs and hold office hours to help students better understand the concepts from lecture. I'm also responsible for helping to make and grade the homework assignments and exams.
                            </p>


                            <i>Help Desk Technical Assistant</i>
                            <p>
                            During my first few semesters at Tech, I worked as a technical assistant at the Georgia Tech College of Computing TSO Help Desk. At the Help Desk I was responsible for assisting anyone who came in with any kind of computer trouble. I also had to frequently reimage and install software on computers.
                            </p>

                                            <p>For Junior Design (Georgia Tech's capstone course), my team made a game to help young children improve their vocabulary. The game consists of a street that has various words for kids to learn, as well as storefronts containing categories of words that kids can takes quizzes over.</p>

                                            <p>This is a site I made where one can set a timer to stop their Spotify playback. I often fall asleep while music is playing on my desktop, so I made this site to pause the music after a certain amount of time. I also made an option for the volume to gradually decrease as the timer progresses (reaching 0 volume as the timer runs out).</p>

The site tries to make a playlist with artists you haven't listened to yet who are similar to artists you already like.</p>

The heatmap is based on the time of day, so it will adjust based on where crimes are most frequent during different times. The application will also attempt to find the safest route from one point on campus to another.</p>

The bot is written in Python, using the PRAW library as a wrapper for the Reddit API and the Sumy library for handling summarization. It is hosted on a Google Compute Engine instance, where it regularly checks for new summary requests.</p>

The script will then send me an email containing the artist, album title, genre, review score, and a link to the review. This is a nice way for me to get new music recommendations without having to frequently check review sites or music forums.</p>

											<p>Since the FCC's broadband privacy protections were repealed in early 2017, allowing ISPs to collect and sell personal data, I've become more diligent about my VPN usage. I made this script to check once every 10 minutes if I have my VPN on, and if I don't, it will give me a desktop notification letting me know that I may want to turn it back on. (I'm not really a big fan of getting notifications on my desktop, so I made the notification message a little silly to lessen my annoyance from being notified.)</p>

Each of the 10 printers has a site that displays the paper levels. To check the paper levels, one would normally have to log into each of the 10 sites and record each printer's paper level before going out to restock the paper. This was rather tedious and time consuming, so I wrote a Python script that logs into and scrapes all of the websites to check the paper levels. The script then updates a Google spreadsheet with how many reams of paper each printer needs.</p>

                                            <p>I had a ton of fun making this. My cousin and I decided to spend part of our 2015 Thanksgiving break creating a procedurally generated platformer in 48 hours. It is not a fully functional game; however, we were able to get the main gameplay mechanics and basic procedural generation finished.</p>
