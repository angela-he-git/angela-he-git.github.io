Welcome to my website! I’m a sociology PhD candidate at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I work on topics in economic sociology, cultural sociology, and housing. 
<br>
<br>
My research centers on two lines of inquiry. The first examines how people evaluate morally ambiguous and subjective phenomena in the domain of housing. The second, which is the focus of my dissertation, explores the evolution of the cultural dimensions of financialization in the housing market and its consequences for racial segregation and economic inequality. Methodologically, I use survey experiments (causal inference), natural language processing tools, and occasionally semi-structured interviews. Feel free to look around my website to see what I’ve been working on.
