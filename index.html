Welcome to my website! I’m a sociology PhD candidate at Stanford University. Broadly, I am interested in how people make evaluations around morally ambiguous and subjective phenemona, particularly in the domain of housing. Methodologically, I primarily use survey experiments and ocassionally semi-structured interviews. I also have a growing interest in NLP. Feel free to take a look around my website to see what I’ve been working on.
