subtitle: PhD Candidate in Sociology at Stanford University

Welcome to my website! I’m a sociology PhD candidate at Stanford University specializing in economic sociology and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Broadly, I am interested in how people make evaluations of morally ambiguous and subjective phenomena, particularly in the domain of housing. Methodologically, I primarily use survey experiments (causal inference) and occasionally semi-structured interviews. I also have a growing interest in NLP. Feel free to take a look around my website to see what I’ve been working on.
