## Amateur garden

I maintain a plot in my community garden. I try to remember to water it. (Thankfully, the California sun takes care of the bulk of the work.)

## Reminder alert to rest my eyes at my computer

I wrote a rudimentary script in Python to remind myself to rest my eyes every 20 minutes when I'm at my computer. This script will provide an alert on my desktop every 20 minutes with the message: "Time to pet Lola and look at the tree outside! It's important to rest your eyes." It uses a custom icon (a cartoon of my dog) and works on Windows. The custom icon is available for download, or you can use your own.
